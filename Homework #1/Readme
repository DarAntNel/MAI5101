requires python 3.13

In this code parses a txt file containing graph,
parses number of vertices and number of edges,
We read the start vertex and all edges into a list and initializes an adjacency list.
Then uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest distance, and keeps track of the best known distances and path.
Priority queue is used to go to the next closest node to explore
if going through the current node gives a shorter path to a neighbor, update that neighborâ€™s distance and predecessor, and push it back into the heap.
the paths are then reconstructed, Starting from any end node, hop backwards via the prev links until you reach the start.
The list is reversed to get the path in the correct order.
We then print the output
